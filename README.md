<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project ü§î

After trying out various game-server management panels, I realized that most of them lacked the features and user-friendliness that I was looking for. So, I decided to take matters into my own hands and create HyperSpace Game Panel - a comprehensive and intuitive game-server management panel that would cater to the needs of both novice and experienced users alike.

## ‚ö° Introduction to HyperSpaceGamePanel:

HyperSpace Game Panel is an `open-source` project designed to provide a web-based control panel for game servers, allowing server administrators to manage their game servers more efficiently. The project is written in Java and Spring Boot, making it easy to deploy and customize.

The panel comes equipped with a range of features, including real-time server monitoring, player management, game settings configuration, and plugin installation. The user-friendly interface and intuitive navigation make it easy for server administrators to perform these tasks quickly and efficiently, without the need for any technical expertise.

HyperSpace Game Panel also includes an authentication system that allows multiple users to access the panel, each with their own set of permissions. This makes it easy for server administrators to delegate tasks and responsibilities to other team members, without worrying about unauthorized access to critical server settings.
